= Azure Credentials and Permissions

To create an Azure cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)], you will need to get your Azure credentials and verify that you have the correct permissions. You can do this either through https://portal.azure.com/[the Azure portal] or the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI].

To use this feature, you will need an NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

After you add your Azure credentials to your NKS account, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-azure-cluster.html[click here to learn how to create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure]

**Shortcut: Find Your Azure Credentials**

* **Subscription ID:** All Services > Subscriptions > Subscription ID
* **Tenant ID** (Azure calls this the Directory ID): Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID
* **Client ID** (Azure calls this the Application ID): All Services > Filter by “app registrations” > App Registrations > Click your application > Copy the Application ID
* **Client Password** (Azure calls this the Client Secret): All Services > Filter by “app registrations” > App Registrations > Click your application > Certificates & Secrets > Client Secrets > New client secret

== Step 1: Check Your Permissions

Before you begin, or if you get a permissions error, you will want to go through your Azure account to check all of your permissions.

=== Azure User Permissions

Log in to  https://portal.azure.com/[the Azure portal], then go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > App Registrations.**

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/check-user-permissions.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: App Registrations]

* If “Users can register applications” is set to **Yes**, you can proceed.

* If “Users can register applications” is set to **No**, only global administrators can register apps.

=== Azure Account Permissions

Click **Azure Active Directory > Overview** to check your account permissions. In this example, the account’s role is **User**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/user-role.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: User Role]

* If your account is assigned to the **Global administrator** role, you can proceed.
* If your account is assigned to the **User** role, and “Users can register applications” is set to **Yes,** you can proceed.
* If your account is assigned to the **User** role, and “Users can register applications” is set to **No,** you will NOT be able to register an app. You have two options:
        1. Ask your administrator to assign your account to the Global administrator role.
        2. Ask your administrator to enable users to register apps.

=== Azure Subscription Resource Providers

You must have an Azure subscription created and assigned to the Azure directory. In order to work, the subscription must be registered with the resource provider `Microsoft.Network`.

To check this, click **All services > Subscriptions**

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/subscription-id.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Subscription ID]

NOTE: Copy the Subscription ID. You will need it to create your NKS cluster.

The resource provider `Microsoft.Network` is not registered by default. You will need to register it. Select the subscription, then click **Settings: Resource Providers**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/check-resource-providers.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Subscription ID]

Here you can check whether `Microsoft.Network` is registered. If not, find the service and click **Register**.

NOTE: The providers `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.Compute` should also be registered by default. If these have not been registered, find them on the list and register them.

=== Azure Account's Subscription Role

Your account role for the subscription can be **Owner**, **Account Admin**, or **User Access Administrator,** but NOT **Contributor**.

To check this, go to **All Services > Subscriptions** and check the **My Role** column.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/my-subscription-role.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: My Subscription Role]

== Step 2: Create an Azure Application

If you don't already have an app, go to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations** then click **New registration** to create a new one.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/new-app-registration.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Add an new app registration]

In the pop-up window which appears:

* Enter a name for the app.
* Choose the supported account type (Single Tenant, Multitenant, or Multitenant and Personal).
* Set the Redirect URI (optional).
* Click **Register**.

This redirects you to the new application's information page.

NOTE: Copy the Application ID. This is the Client ID you will need to create your NKS cluster.

Next, give your app a role assignment.

Go to **All services > Subscriptions**. Click the subscription you want to use for the app.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/subscription-id.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Subscription ID]

Click **Access Control (IAM) > +Add**. In the drop-down menu which appears, choose **Add role assignment**.

In the pop-up window which appears:

* Choose `Contributor` for the role.
* Leave the **Assign access to** drop-down menu at the default choice, `Azure AD user, group, or service principal`.
* Search for your app by pasting the App ID into the **Select** field.

Your app will appear in the search results. Click your app, then click **Save**.

== Step 3: Create a Client Password (Client Secret)

On the App Registrations page, click your app, then click **Certificates & Secrets > +New client secret**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/new-client-secret.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Create new client secret]

Fill in the description and expiration date, then click **Add** to generate the key.

IMPORTANT: Copy and save the Client Secret. This is the Client Password you will need to create your NKS cluster. You will not be able to view the Client Secret after you leave this page.

If you lose your Client Secret, you will need to create a new one.

== Find Your Existing Azure Credentials

To create an Azure cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need the Subscription ID, Tenant (Directory) ID, and Client (Application) ID.

**Shortcut: Find Your Azure Credentials**

* **Subscription ID:** All Services > Subscriptions > Subscription ID
* **Tenant ID** (Azure calls this the Directory ID): Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID
* **Client ID** (Azure calls this the Application ID): All Services > Filter by “app registrations” > App Registrations > Click your application > Copy the Application ID
* **Client Password** (Azure calls this the Client Secret): All Services > Filter by “app registrations” > App Registrations > Click your application > Certificates & Secrets > Client Secrets > New client secret

=== Find Your Azure Subscription ID

Sign in to your Azure account through the https://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal]. Go to **All services > Subscriptions** and copy the Subscription ID.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/subscription-id.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Subscription ID]

=== Find Your Azure Tenant ID

Click **Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID.**  This is the Tenant ID you need to create your NKS cluster.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/tenant-id.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Tenant ID]

=== Find Your Azure Client ID

Go to **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**. Copy the Application ID. This is the Client ID you will need to create your NKS cluster.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/app-id.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: App ID]

=== Find Your Azure Client Password (Secret)

Go to **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations**. Click your app, then click **Certificates & Secrets > +New client secret**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-azure/new-client-secret.png?raw=true[Azure Auth: Create new client secret]

Fill in the description and expiration date, then click **Add** to generate the key.

IMPORTANT: Copy and save the Client Secret. This is the Client Password you will need to create your NKS cluster. You will not be able to view the Client Secret after you leave this page.

If you lose your Client Secret, you will need to create a new one.



== Use the Azure CLI

**Authentication Parameters**

* **Subscription ID:** Azure calls this "ID" in the output of the `az login` command.
* **Tenant ID**: Azure calls this the Directory ID.
* **Client ID**: Azure calls this the Application ID.

Log in to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI].

----
az login
----

Follow the instructions to authenticate. After the log-in and authentication process is complete, this will output account information including the Subscription ID.

NOTE: The Subscription ID is labeled "ID" in the output of the `az login` command.

Set the account with the subscription ID.

----
az account set --subscription "[subscription ID]"
----

For example, if the subscription ID is **a123-b456-c789** the command is:

----
az account set --subscription "a123-b456-c789"
----

Create a resource group if one does not already exist.

----
az group create -n "[resource group name]" -l "westus"
----

For example, if the resource group name is **myResourceGroup** the command is:

----
az group create -n "myResourceGroup" -l "westus"
----

Create the service principal:

----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]"
----

For example, if the subscription ID is **a123-b456-c789** and the resource group name is **myResourceGroup**, the command is:

----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/a123-b456-c789/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup" -o table
----

This will output account information including the app ID.

Assign the service principal with the role **Contributor**:

----
az role assignment create --assignee [appID] --role Contributor
----

For example, if the app ID is **1234-5678**, the command is:

----
az role assignment create --assignee 1234-5678 --role Contributor
----
