= Enable NKS for Your NetApp HCI Account

To use NKS with NetApp HCI, you will need to enable it for your NetApp HCI account. To do this, use the NetApp HCI Hybrid Cloud Control wizard to enable cloud services on NetApp HCI.

For more details on using the Hybrid Cloud Control wizard, see the http://docs.netapp.com/hci/topic/com.netapp.doc.hci-ude-160/GUID-5BD8591B-0717-409E-93BC-7C4919DF19CF.html[NetApp HCI documentation^].

NOTE: The following steps will enable cloud volumes with a 90-day trial license. To convert the trial license to a production license, upload the NetApp license file (.nlf file) to your account.

== Log In at NetApp Cloud Central

To access the NetApp HCI Hybrid Cloud Control wizard, go to the IP address of the management node in a browser.

If you don't have a Cloud Central login, you will be prompted to create one. Otherwise, click to enable NetApp Cloud Services.

== Enable Cloud Services

Go to **Enable Cloud Services > Services**, then select the services that you want to enable. In addition to NKS, you can also enable Cloud Volumes and Cloud Insights here.

* *Cloud Volumes*: This service provides an on-demand shared file systems feature on your premises. Cloud Volumes also enables data fabric replication to and from public clouds.
* *Cloud Insights*: Monitor cloud services on NetApp HCI.

After choosing the service(s) you wish to enable, click **Continue** to go to the next step.

== Add Your NKS API Token

On this step, you will add your NKS API token. You can use an existing NKS API token if you have one. If you don't already have an API token, click the link to https://nks.netapp.io/user/profile[your NKS User Profile page] to create one.

Paste the API token into the field, then click **Connect**.

This creates your registration and connects you to Cloud Central.

== Register Your Installation

On the Enable Cloud Services step, select your Cloud Central organization and region name.

The region name is used to identify your NetApp HCI installation. It is also used as the site name for any NKS clusters created on this installation.

Click *Continue* to go to the next step.

== Select vCenter Resources

On the vCenter step, choose your Data center and Cluster. After you select these, the vCenter instance and related admin user will be displayed.

Click *Continue* to go to the next step.

== Select Networking Options

On the Networking page, review and configure the following:

* **NetApp Kubernetes Service Management Network**: Enter the IP addresses and info for your NKS service and workload clusters.
*	**NetApp Kubernetes Service Workload Network**: Enter the network information needed by your workload clusters (where you will host your applications). When you create your workload clusters, NKS uses the IP addresses entered here.
*	**NetApp Kubernetes Service Data Network**: Enter the network information to connect your Kubernetes workload clusters to persistent volume claims (PVCs) on your NetApp HCI system.

Click *Continue* to review and confirm your choices.

== Review

On the Review page, review your choices by expanding each option. When you are sure your options are all set correctly, click *Continue* to enable NetApp HCI cloud services.

This redirects you to the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control page. The Enable NetApp Cloud Services tile now shows the number of services enabled.

NetApp HCI uses NKS to create a Kubernetes cluster which consists of four VMs (one Kubernetes master node and three Kubernetes worker compute nodes).

You can now use NKS to create Kubernetes clusters on your NetApp HCI system.
