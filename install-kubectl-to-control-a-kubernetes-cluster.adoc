summary: Learn how to install kubectl to control a Kubernetes cluster.
---

Kubectl is the command line interface for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. In many cases, you will not need to use kubectl with a Kubernetes cluster on https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)]. You can easily create and manage clusters through the NKS Control Plane.

If you don’t already have an NKS account, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

**Overview**

Kubectl gets its cluster connection and login information from the cluster’s `kubeconfig` file. In order to use kubectl you will need to:

1. Install kubectl on your local machine.
2. Download the cluster’s kubeconfig file from the NKS Cluster Details page.
3. Move the kubeconfig file to your user directory, then update your shell’s environment.

More kubectl documentation can be found https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/[on the official Kubernetes site].

== Windows

The easiest way to install kubectl on Windows is to use https://chocolatey.org/[the Chocolatey package manager]. You can install Chocolatey with a single command from a PowerShell or cmd window. The installation instructions for both Administrator and non-Administrator rights are https://chocolatey.org/install[here on the Chocolatey website].

After you have installed Chocolatey, open PowerShell or cmd, then install kubectl with the command:

----
choco install kubernetes-cli
----

Move to your home directory:

----
cd C:\users\[your username]
----

For example:

----
cd C:\users\jdoe
----

Create the `.kube` directory:

----
mkdir .kube
----

Move to the `.kube` directory:

----
cd .kube
----

In a web browser, log in to the StackPointcloud Control Plane. Click on your cluster to view the details. Download your cluster’s `kubeconfig` file from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

Move this file to the `C:\users\yourusername\.kube` directory. Then update your shell environment to call the file:

----
$env:KUBECONFIG="C:\users\[your username]\.kube\[kubeconfig file name]"
----

For example:

----
$env:KUBECONFIG="C:\users\jdoe\.kube\kubeconfig"
----


== Mac OS

You can install kubectl on MacOS using either the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] or https://www.macports.org/[Macports] package managers.

To install with Homebrew, open a Terminal window and use the command:

----
brew install kubernetes-cli
----

To install with Macports, open a Terminal window and use the command:

----
port install kubectl
----

In a web browser, log in to the StackPointCloud Control Plane. Click on your cluster to view the details. Download your cluster’s `kubeconfig` file from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

Move this file to your home directory:

----
mv /Users/username/Downloads/kubeconfig /Users/username/
----

Then update your shell environment to call the file:

----
export KUBECONFIG=/Users/username/kubeconfig
----

== External Linux Server

Another option is to SSH to a server, install kubectl, then use it to control your Kubernetes cluster. If you have access to a Linux server, there are several advantages to this approach:

* If you have root on the server, you will be able to install the Kubernetes software without having to deal with any desktop computer permissions problems.
* Speaking of computer permissions issues, I have found that in order to run Kubernetes on my Windows laptop, I need to run PowerShell on Windows as Administrator. If you are not able to run applications with administrator rights, you can avoid the issue by connecting to a Linux server with SSH and running kubectl from there.
* If you frequently find yourself using several different computers, you can SSH to the server from anywhere. This saves you from having to install Kubernetes on every machine you use.
* If you have customized your SSH program to your liking (fonts, colors, etc.) it can be nicer to use it than the stock terminal or PowerShell window.

To install kubectl on a Linux server, follow the instructions for your distribution.

=== Ubuntu, Debian, and HypriotOS

Install with the commands:

----
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https

curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
----

=== CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora

Install with the commands:

----
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg     https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
EOF

yum install -y kubectl

In a web browser, log in to the StackPointCloud Control Plane. Click on your cluster to view the details. Download your cluster’s `kubeconfig` file from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen. Upload the file to the server. Then update your shell environment to call the file:

----
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
----

For example:

----
export KUBECONFIG=/usr/home/jdoe/kubeconfig
----
