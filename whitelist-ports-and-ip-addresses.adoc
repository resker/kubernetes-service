= Whitelist Ports and IP Addresses

We recommend you secure your clusters as appropriate for your infrastructure needs.

If you decide to restrict access to your cluster, you will need to whitelist the following ports and IP addresses so that the https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] system will continue to work correctly:

Ports:

* 12443 (proxy to dashboard)
* 6443 (Kubernetes API)
* 443
* 22 (Kubernetes upgrades and other local tasks)

IP addresses:

* 34.208.181.140
* 54.187.65.159
* 34.217.162.31
