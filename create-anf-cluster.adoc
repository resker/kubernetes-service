Learn the fast, easy way to create a Kubernetes cluster with Azure NetApp Files using https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)].

Azure NetApp Files (ANF) is an enterprise-class, high-performance file storage service which is highly available and offers tiered service and performance levels, as well as many other features. Learn how to easily use this high-performance file storage method with your NKS Kubernetes clusters.

**Requirements**

* ANF set up and configured on your Azure account. For more information about setting up and using Azure NetApp Files, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/[see the official documentation on the Microsoft website].
* An NKS account. If you donâ€™t have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

Configure ANF by choosing the NetApp account, capacity pool, service level, and subnet you wish to use. When everything is set, click **SAVE** to continue and return to the cluster configuration page.

Finally, review your cluster settings and make any necessary configuration changes:

* Set the cluster name.
* Change the Kubernetes version.
* Add other solutions to the cluster from our solutions gallery, trusted charts, or your own Helm chart repo.
* Change the OS distribution.
