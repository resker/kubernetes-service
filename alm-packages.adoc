= Application Lifecycle Management: Packages

A Package is one of three types of Solutions that can be added to your Application Lifecycle Management Project. Keep reading to find out how to use Packages.

To use this feature, you will need an NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

== Packages

Packages are Helm charts. You will find a number of commonly-used Packages available to added to your Project. You also have the option to import your own charts from an external repository.

NOTE: Application Lifecycle Management is currently in Functional Preview mode. To enable this feature you will need to create a new cluster, and "Enable experimental features."

=== Add a Package

Navigate into your Project details page.

From the Overview tab, you can scroll down to the Solutions section and then click the ** + Add Solution** button.

Another option is to switch from the Project Overview tab to the Project Solutions tab and then click the ** + Add Solution** button.

Either way, you should end up at the same place.

Click the button labeled **+ Add A New Package**. This will bring up the **Select Solution Package** page which has its own set of Charts navigation tabs and a Search field.

Selecting the **Trusted Helm Charts** tab displays the galley of included charts.

Click on any of the cards to bring up details about it. For example, clicking on the "rethinkdb" card takes us to a screen where we can:

- Customize the package name.
- Select a specific version.
- Customize the values YAML.

Make any desired changes and then press the **Create Package** button to continue.

It will take a little while for the package to install.

The red circle with an ! icon will be replaced by a green circle with a check mark when the package is ready.

=== View Installed Packages

Navigate back to *Project Name -> Solutions -> Packages* to see the list of installed packages.

image::assets/documentation/alm-packages/installed-packages.png?raw=true[NKS installed packages]

You can click on the name of the package to bring up its configuration screen. It will look similar to the one used to install the package.

=== Manage Chart Repos

Navigating back to the Select Solutions Package screen, you will find a button labeled *Manage Chart Repos*.

image::assets/documentation/alm-packages/select-solution-package.png?raw=true[NKS select solution package]

Pressing that button will begin the process of bringing in your own charts from an external repository. You also have the option of starting the process by navigating through **Solutions -> My Charts** and using the **+ Import Charts** button.

There is a three step wizard that walks you through the process of importing charts.

==== Select Source

The first step has a few options available.

- You may accept the random name assigned as the *Chart Repository Name*, or replace it. Be sure to follow the naming requirements. (Lowercase letters, digits, and dashes only.)
- Use the radio button under Source to specify the repository type. (GitHub or Packaged Charts)
- Provide the Repository URL.

If the GitHub repository is private, you may check the box and provide credentials to enable access.

For Packaged Charts, provide the requested URL.

==== Select Repository

NKS will use the supplied information to verify access to the GitHub Repository or Packaged Charts URL.

If everything checks out properly, you may continue by pressing the *Save Repository* button.

The charts will be imported. This process happens fairly quickly, and you are provided with visual feedback in the *State* column.

The *State* column updates from a progress bar to a green circle with white check mark when complete.

=== Verify Imported Charts

The imported charts should appear in the *Project -> Solutions* tab when you click the **+ Add Solution** and then **+ Add a New Package** buttons.

NOTE: The *Charts -> My Charts* tab can be used to filter the display to exclude Trusted Helm Charts.

Selecting the chart allows you to configure and install it in a process similar to "Add a Package" described above.
