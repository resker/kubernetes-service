= SSH to a Node in an NKS Cluster

Whenever possible, you will want to use Dockerfiles or the `kubectl` command to interact with a cluster. However, there are some cases when you may need (or want) to SSH directly to a node in an NKS cluster.

To use this feature, you will need an NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

NOTE: If you are familiar with using SSH to interact with a Linux server, the username is `core` (on ContainerLinux) or `ubuntu` (on Ubuntu). Download the SSH keys from your NKS Profile page, then use them to authenticate on the node.

You can log in as the user `core` (on ContainerLinux) or `ubuntu` (on Ubuntu) with a command like:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa core@192.168.0.1
```

== Get the SSH Keys

To improve security, NKS nodes use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords. You will need to download and install these SSH keys before you can SSH to a node in the cluster. You will need to install the SSH keys on your desktop computer.

Log in to https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] and go to **Organization > Setup**. In the **SSH Keys** section, click the "download" icon to download your SSH keypair.

Unzip the contents of this file, and move both files to the desired directory on your computer. By common convention, this directory is `/home/[your username]/.ssh` on Linux and Mac, and `C:\[your username]\.ssh` on Windows.

== SSH to the Node

To find the public IP for the node, go to the NKS **Control Plane** and click the cluster's name. Note the Public IP address for the node.

Open a Terminal (on Mac) or PuTTY (on Windows) session and SSH to the node:

```
ssh -i [/path/to/id_rsa] [login name]@[public IP address]
```

The login name will depend on the nodeâ€™s operating system:

* ContainerLinux: `core`
* Ubuntu: `ubuntu`

For example, the command to connect to a ContainerLinux node at IP address 192.168.0.1 when you have stored your SSH keys in the `/home/JDoe/.ssh` directory is:

```
ssh -i /home/JDoe/.ssh/id_rsa core@192.168.0.1
```

This will connect you to the node.
