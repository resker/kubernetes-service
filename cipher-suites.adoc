= Cipher Suites

The following cipher suites are used for SSL/TLS handshakes with the NKS API and web views. This documentation was last tested and validated on July 2019.

Note that the cipher suites are presented in descending order of server preference. That means the `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` suite will be used if the client supports it.

|===
| *Cipher Suite Name* | *TLS 1.0* | *TLS 1.1* | *TLS 1.2*
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 | no  | no  | yes
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 | no  | no  | yes
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA    | yes | yes | yes
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 | no  | no  | yes
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 | no  | no  | yes
| TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA    | yes | yes | yes
